The StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform performs a risk analysis of the container environment, delivers visibility and runtime alerts, and provides recommendations to proactively improve security by hardening the environment. StackRox integrates with every stage of container lifecycle: build, deploy and runtime.

The StackRox Kubernetes Security platform is built on the foundation of the product formerly known as Prevent, which itself was called Mitigate and Apollo. You may find references to these previous names in code or documentation.
